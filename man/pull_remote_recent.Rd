\item{briefcase}{Filename of the downloaded ODK Briefcase \code{.jar} file.
Default is \code{odkBriefcase_latest} to match the default filename used
by \code{get_briefcase()}. If ODK Briefcase \code{.jar} file was

\item{to}{Destination directory for pulled ODK forms}

\item{from}{URL of remote ODK Aggregate server to pull ODK forms data from}

\item{include_incomplete}{Logical. Should incomplete forms be pulled? Default
to FALSE}
